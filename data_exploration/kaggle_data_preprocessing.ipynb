    "The combination is the same as in  our baseline project. This includes that we will only use 4 quadrants as moods (happy, sad, calm anger) by combining all the lower level moods appropriately, based on the keywords used to label them. We also incuded more moods than the baseline project, which discarded the following: dreamy, desire, earnest, pessimism, romantic, brooding, whereas we discarded desire, romantic, confident, dreamy (as it was not present in the dataset)\n",
